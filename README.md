# Ethan Raphael
Welcome to my GitHub. I am currently a student at **Ecole Centrale de Marseille** and **University of Amsterdam**, pursuiing my gap year with a focus on mathematical and computational finance, quantitative research and machine learning. My projects explore applied financial mathematics and their market reality, as well as their the intersection between machine learning, quantitative trading and risk management.

---

## Areas of Interest
- **Quantitative Finance, Derivatives Trading, risk modelling**  
  Pricing and hedging strategies using Black-Scholes, Heston, and CIR models. Calibration, volatility surface modeling, and portfolio risk analysis (credit and market risk).

- **Energy Markets & Forecasting**  
  Seasonal time series modeling (ARIMA, Prophet) and dynamic pricing techniques for commodities like gas and power. Interest in power purchase agreements, structured products, and volatility.

- **Machine Learning & Decision Algorithms**  
  Reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandits, online learning (UCB, EXP3), online-to-batch conversion, boosting algorithms.

- **Operational Research & Stochastic Control**  
  Application of stochastic processes (Brownian motion, martingales, Markov chains, Feller-Dynkin) to resource allocation and exploration problems (inspired by Peter Tankov’s work).

## Projects soon to be uploaded on this GitHub

### EEG Diagnostic App (Medical AI, Full-Stack Python)
> Real-time deep learning application for epilepsy detection using EEG signals
- Custom **Tkinter GUI** with secure practitioner login, dynamic patient registry, and PDF report generation
- PyTorch classifier using statistical feature extraction and neural inference
- Self-improving AI via feedback-based retraining and database expansion (Bonn dataset)

### Option Pricing & Volatility Surface Simulation
> From Black-Scholes to Heston: clean, practical code for option traders and quant researchers
- Monte Carlo pricing engine with Newton-Raphson implied volatility solver
- Simulation of volatility surfaces using FFT and log-return skewness
- Streamlit app to visualize Greeks and test strategies in real time
- Exploratory calculation of VaR

### Market Forecasting & Portfolio Signals
> Tools to analyze market regimes and strategy performance under real conditions
- Seasonal ARIMA and Prophet models on energy data (gas, power)
- Strategy backtests over 5+ years using classical indicators (momentum, RSI, mean-reversion)
- Exploratory hedging simulation using Greeks-based filters

### JP Morgan Quantitative Simulation
> Two-track analytical submission
- **Commodities track**: built forecasting pipelines, priced contracts under stress scenarios, and compared model residuals
- **Risk track**: applied FICO bucketing, PD estimation, and loan book simulation under default scenarios
